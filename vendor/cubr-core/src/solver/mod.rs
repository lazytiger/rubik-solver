//! Hybrid Rubik's-cube solver: guaranteed-optimal Korf IDA* under a wall-clock budget,
//! with a near-optimal Kociemba two-phase fallback for the deep tail.
//!
//! No Bevy types or systems live here — this mirrors [`crate::core`] in being a pure,
//! fully unit-tested module. The Bevy layer (`solve_ui`, in the `cubr` binary)
//! loads/generates the
//! [`Pdbs`] off-thread and feeds states through [`solve`].
//!
//! ## The hybrid
//! Both public entry points ([`solve`] and [`Solver::solve`]) delegate to [`run_hybrid`],
//! which runs the guaranteed-optimal Korf IDA* ([`search::search`]) with a wall-clock
//! budget (default ~4 s, [`DEFAULT_KORF_BUDGET_MS`]). If Korf finishes within budget the
//! answer is the exact optimum; if the budget expires (the rare near-God's-number states),
//! it falls back to the near-optimal in-house two-phase ([`two_phase::solve`]) from the same
//! state, so even distance-17–20 cubes return a solution in milliseconds. An external cancel
//! is honoured throughout (-> [`SolveError::Cancelled`]).
//!
//! ## The facelet boundary
//! Parse/validate is now fully in-house. A [`CubeState`] is concatenated into a 54-char
//! URFDLB facelet string (via [`color_to_facelet_char`] / [`state_to_facelets`]) and that
//! string is converted straight to our [`coords::Cubies`] integer arrays — and validated
//! for physical solvability — by [`facelet::facelets_to_cubies`] (a port of kewb's
//! `cube/{facelet,cubie}.rs`; wrong color counts / bad parity become
//! [`SolveError::Unsolvable`]). All coordinate math, the pattern databases, and the search
//! run on our own arrays. `kewb` is no longer a runtime dependency — it is kept only as a
//! dev-dependency test oracle (the `facelet_conversion_matches_kewb` cross-check below and
//! the `compose_matches_kewb_*` guards in `coords`).
//!
//! The facelet alphabet is face *letters* `U R F D L B` laid out in face order
//! **U, R, F, D, L, B**, 9 facelets each, row-major. Our [`CubeState`] uses the same face
//! order (its struct fields) and the README per-face read order is already the
//! Kociemba-style layout (mirrored `B`), so the conversion is a straight concatenation
//! once each sticker color is mapped to the face letter of the face whose solved center is
//! that color (`W->U, R->R, G->F, Y->D, O->L, B->B`).
